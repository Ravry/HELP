Hey, im having an issue with the rotation handling when rotating the cinemachine free look camera (position control: Orbital Follow & Rotation Control: Rotation Composor)
The jittering can not be seen in scene view from which i'am assuming that it must have sth to do with the cinemachine. 
Would be a pleasure if some(1) would have a look at it. <3 just open Scenes/SampleScene
